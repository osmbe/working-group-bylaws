The non-profit organization builds an inclusive community of volunteers and organizations that maintain the map data. The non-profit organization defends the vision of the Belgian OpenStreetMap community within the international structures of the OpenStreetMap project.

#### Article I.4: Duration

### Title II: Members

#### Article II.1: Natural persons

- The non-profit organization seeks the largest possible number of members, provided they are active within the organization.
- The minimum number of members is 10.
- All natural persons can become members upon simple request to the governing body of the asbl. The governing body then further explains the expectations of the non-profit organization towards (candidate) members: the names of the members are publicly available, the member is expected to come to meetings and commit to the non-profit organization. Once the prospective member confirms to meet these expectations, the membership starts automatically.
- Membership is free of charge.
- Members are not anonymous. There is a public list of members' names. It is allowed but not required to also publish the OpenStreetMap username on that list. The list also contains address information, but it is not published.
- Membership may be suspended by the Governing Body for non-compliance with the Code of Conduct as documented at [osm.be/c_o_c](https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In case of suspension, termination of membership will be put on the agenda at the next General Assembly.
- Members may automatically be considered resigning. The organization expects a minimum level of participation from its members. Anyone who fails to participate (by proxy or otherwise) at two consecutive General Assemblies and does not apologize will be considered resigning.
- Membership may be terminated at any time by the member subject to an email to the governing body.
- Members from 60 days of membership are entitled to vote at the general meeting and for board elections.

#### Article II.2: Legal entities as affiliate members (_corporate membership_)

- Any organization that subscribes to the mission of OpenStreetMap Belgium can become an affiliated member.
- Membership starts for one year on the day of receipt of the membership fee.
- The membership fee is differentiated between SMEs and other organizations. It amounts to 1000 euro for SMEs and 2500 euro for other organizations and can be doubled by the General Assembly. The amount can be adjusted annually by decision of a general assembly. The membership fee can be paid partly in the form of services in kind to the non-profit organization, in negotiation with the governing body.
- The membership fee can be fixed at a general meeting.
- OpenStreetMap Belgium supports the OSM-related projects of its members, with advice and internal promotion.
- In principle, OpenStreetMap Belgium always shows the logos of its corporate members during events and on promotional material.
- Corporate members are affiliated members only, and thus have no voting rights during the general assembly, nor for the governing body. They may, however, participate in general meetings unless there is a closed session.
- Membership can be cancelled by the organization at any time. However, membership fees are not refundable.
- Membership may be terminated by a 2/3rds majority vote at a general meeting for non-compliance with the code of conduct or for actions that are clearly contrary to the mission of the non-profit organization.
