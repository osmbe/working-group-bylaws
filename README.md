# OSM Belgium - Working group bylaws

This repository contains all oficial documentation regarding the working of OSM.be vzw/asbl. Until July 21st 2023 OSM Belgium was a part of Open Knowledge Belgium VZW, which served as an umbrella organization. The bylaws back then were just for our group, and had no realy 'legal' meaning. This version was approved on 21/02/2017 and is [still available here](https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/blob/6f30f751b409e0464be3e25ffbf6368eeafcd81f/CONSTITUTION.md).

On December 1st 2023, the OpenStreetMap Belgium ASBL was officially founded. The official bylaws were published in the Belgian official journal at that date. The same content can be found in Dutch here on Github: https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/blob/master/CONSTITUTION-nl.md . An unofficial translation to English is available here: https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md
