# Board

Daily operations are run by the OpenStreetMap Belgium board.
They can be reached at board@osm.be

The current Board consists of 
- Jonathan Beliën
- Joost Schouppe
- Thierry Jimenez

The initial board was elected during the [foundational meeting](https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/blob/master/minutes/2017-02-21%20-%20initial%20meeting.txt) and consisted of:

- Ben Abelshausen
- Jonathan Beliën
- Joost Schouppe

This board was subsequently relected for another two years in 2019 during [the 29/11 official meeting](https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/blob/master/minutes/2019-11-29%20-%20official%20meeting.md).

In the election of 2021, Ben decided to step down. He was replaced by Thierry Jimenez. The election was held on OpaVote. Since there were only three candidates, for only three seats, the question to the members was if they accept the three candidates or not. 17 of 25 members vote, all of them in favour.
