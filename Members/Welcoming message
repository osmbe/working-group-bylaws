Hello Johan,

Welcome aboard! We're looking forward to your contributions to the organization!

We keep a public record of our members at https://members.osm.be/view/members . The real name is obligatory there (as this is a sign of public support for the mission). For privacy reasons, the username is optional. Would you like to include your username or not?

The most active Belgian community channel is on Matrix/Element. The general room is here: https://app.element.io/#/room/#osmbe:matrix.org
We also have a members-only chatroom that has much less volume. If you pass us your Matrix username, we can add you to that room.

There are one or two members' meetings per year - sometimes online, sometimes IRL. We have a low number of members, but they are generally quite active. We have a minimum engagement rule and pretty strict quorum rules. The invites for those meetings are by e-mail, sent out by community@osm.be . We also send reminders on the private chatroom.

All our internal proceedings are public and online at https://github.com/osmbe/working-group-bylaws/
- the annual reports are handy to get an idea about what we are working on
- minutes contains notes from the board & members meetings
- financial has our current financial status

Some of the ideas we're working on are here: https://github.com/osmbe/community_planning/issues
Though our most active projects are documented on osm.be and our top mapping tasks list.

Welcome on board,
Joost Schouppe
